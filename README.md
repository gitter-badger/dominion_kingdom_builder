Dominion Kingdom Builder
========================

There are other similar programs to this floating about the internet, but let me just float this one along too.  The other apps usually refer to themselves as dominion deck builders, but this is a bit of a misnomer since you're choosing decks to use in the supply.  

So _THIS_ app allows you to choose the 10 random decks to add to the supply (the Kingdom) in addition to the starting treasures, victory and curse cards.  (Actually, there's no enforcement of 10 decks to use in your Kingdom.)
