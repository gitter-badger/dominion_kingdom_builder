Dominion Supply Builder
=======================

There are other similar programs to this floating about the internet, but let me just float this one along too.  The other apps usually refer to themselves as dominion deck builders, but this is a bit of a misnomer since you're choosing decks to use in the supply.  

So _THIS_ app allows you to choose the random 10 decks to add to the supply in addition to the starting treasures, victory and curse cards.  (Actually, there's no enforcement of 10 decks to use.)

The benefit of this app above the others are **NUMEROUS**.  Well at least a couple...

 * It's open source - Add or remove features.  If I like your changes, I'll merge them.  If I don't like you're changes, I'll tell you why.  
 * Support for multiple supply piles from a single collection --
